This Python-based Expense Tracker allows users to record, store, and review their daily expenses using a CSV file for data persistence. The program lets users add expenses by entering the date, category, amount, and description. It also provides two viewing options: a summary report showing total and category-wise spending, and a detailed list displaying all recorded entries. The project uses Python concepts such as file handling, CSV operations, loops, functions, and date validation to create a practical and user-friendly financial management tool.
